## About this Repository
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of regression models for predicting car prices using a dataset from Yalla Motors. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, LASSO, Ridge, Polynomial Regression, and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are also conducted.

## Overview
This project explores different regression models to predict car prices using a dataset from Yalla Motors. We implement various techniques, including:

- Linear Regression (Closed Form & Gradient Descent)
- Regularization (LASSO, Ridge)
- Polynomial Regression
- Radial Basis Function (RBF)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 6,308 car entries with attributes such as price, engine capacity, horsepower, and more. Various preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature selection, were applied.
